#  SKCamera

By default SKTiledKit creates a camera of the same size as the map and ensures it is fully visible. This is not always desirable, and the SKCamera type allows you to draw a rectangle that forms a view port on the scene and can optionally track another object such as they player (see [Camera Properties](Properties.md#camera) for more details).
