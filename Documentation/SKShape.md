#  SKShape

Shapes enable Tiled objects like rectangles to have a presence on the scene. You may hide them (set as not visible in Tiled), but as long you as at least still capture a [physical property](Properties.md#physical) they will enable you 
to specify collision and contact areas. Of course you may also draw them in the the scene by making them visible and setting the fill and stroke colors.
