#  SKSprite

SKSprite's enable you to capture almost all attributes you will need to fill for an `SKSprite` you want to appear in your SpriteKit scenes. It's important to remember you can set the type of tiles in tilesets, and SKTiledKit uses that information when creating instances to place in your scene. This makes Tilesets not just a repository for backgrounds, but also enables you to preconfigure them to be used and replicated dynamically during game play.
