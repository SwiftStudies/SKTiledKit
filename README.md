# SKTiledKit

A Swift Package for reading [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org) levels that makes it easy to use with [SpriteKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit) and provides a command line utility that provides (amongst other things) the ability to preview levels directly from Tiled.
